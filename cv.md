3. Information about me: My main goal in life has always been to achieve something new, more interesting. And now, a new stage has come in my life. I graduated from the Belarusian National Technical University in 2015. I went to work as an electromechanical mining engineer. I supervised people and worked in very dangerous conditions in the mine. The work was difficult and at first I even liked it. However, at the beginning of 2021, my best friend talked me about the «JavaScript/Front-end» сourse trom the «RS-school» community, which interested me very much. After weighing all the risks, I decided to quit my main job. And here I am, at Frontend Development, ready to devote my life to this process. Yes, I don't know much yet, but now I have enough free time and have a great desire to become a real Frontend developer.
